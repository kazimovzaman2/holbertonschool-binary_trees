## Introduction

Binary trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science, and this project explores various operations and algorithms related to them. This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to the tasks assigned during my study of binary trees at Holberton School.

## Repository Contents

- `binary_tree_print.c`: Utility function to print binary trees.
- `binary_trees.h`: Header file containing function prototypes and structure definitions.
- `LICENSE`: GPL-3.0 License file.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository.
- Various C files implementing solutions to specific tasks, such as:
  - `0-binary_tree_node.c`: Implementation of a function to create a binary tree node.
  - `1-binary_tree_insert_left.c`: Implementation of a function to insert a node as the left-child of another node in a binary tree.
  - and more...

## Usage

To use any of the provided implementations, you can simply include the respective header file (`binary_trees.h`) in your C project and link against the necessary source files.

Example:

```c
#include "binary_trees.h"

int main(void) {
    /* Your code here */
    return 0;
}
```

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have any improvements or new solutions to the binary tree tasks, feel free to submit a pull request.
